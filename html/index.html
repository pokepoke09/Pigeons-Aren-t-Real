<h3 >The term “Birds Aren’t Real” refers to biological “Birds” no longer existing on United States soil. After the government forcibly made the entire species extinct in the 20th century, all of these real birds were replaced with surveillance drones designed to look just like Birds. To simplify- Birds no longer exist in the U.S. as a biological lifeform, thus, Birds Aren’t Real!</h3>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">What About Eggs?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The “eggs” we see in the 21st century are specifically designed by the government to appear indistinguishable from what eggs once were, when birds were real. When the government replaced the species with robotic replicas, it was key that these replicas sustained the same activities that their biological predecessors did, including producing edible eggs.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">What About Bird Poop?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Bird poop was originally thought to be oil discharge from earlier bird drone models. After further research though, this was disproven. Bird poop irregularly falls on vehicles in large amounts. Recent studies show that 87% of Bird Poop in populated areas falls on people’s cars. Why is this? Confidential documents leaked in 2018 revealing that “Bird Poop” is actually a form of liquidated tracking apparatus. If you walk outside and notice some bird poop just “happened” to fall on your car, be aware that you are now being tracked by the United States Government. It is recommended you clean your car exterior regularly to avoid this.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">How Do You Explain Bird Meat?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>All “Meat” found in “Birds” today is 100% synthetic. If birds suddenly became inedible, the government’s entire scheme would have been compromised. In order for their transition from “Real Bird to Drone Replica” to make sense, they had to imitate all parts of real birds in their robot copies. This includes tasty, edible meat- just synthetic. Synthetic meat is actually very accessible in modern times, with many fast food operations openly using it in their meals. The government simply had access to these modern technologies decades before the public.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">What About Hunted Birds, And Road Kill?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>This entire question is based off of a flawed understanding of what a “Robot” is. With major technological advances only recently being made in the 20th century, many still think that a “Robot” can only be a metallic machine with gears and wires. Bird Drones are not this. The government has access to futuristic technologies making it possible to create a “robot” using parts indistinguishable from a biological organism. After all, if the robot replicas didn’t look and feel exactly like real birds (inside and out)- the entire plot would be exposed.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I Have A Pet Bird, What Do I Do?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Not to startle you, but you have a highly advanced governmental surveillance drone in your house, watching your every movement, picking up every word of your conversations, and sending that data into to the pentagon. “Pet Birds” were actually unheard of before 2001, when all Birds became surveillance drones. At this time, the government started a propaganda campaign normalizing “Pet Birds” (if you think about it, a Pet Bird in a cage doesn’t even make sense- the animals are supposed to have endless sky to explore, not to be held within a cage in a house). You would be best advised to not bring up any matters you’d prefer to remain confidential around your “Pet Bird”.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are All Birds Surveillance Drones?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>While most birds are designed specifically for public surveillance purposes, this does not mean that is all the government is doing with them. Bird Drones can have multiple applications based on type, for example, “Vultures” are not surveillance drones, they are used for public sanitation (roadkill specifically). Another example is Hummingbirds, which are used as Assassination Drones, spearing targets with their long needle beaks.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">I Have Encountered A Bird, I Am Scared. What Do I Do?</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>First, breathe- remain calm. It is vital to not panic, and remember that this experience is not abnormal- these birds have likely been watching you for most of your life. Once you have regained your composure, look the bird straight in the eyes and declare the following statement confidently “I know your secret. I know that you are a surveillance drone in disguise. I know that behind those beady eyes are cameras, soaking up data and sending it to the pentagon. I am onto you. I know you are not real.” - By vocally establishing dominance over the drone in this moment, your fear should subside, allowing you to remember that you are the human, and that is merely a robot.</p>
